# Median-Housing-Prices
Machine Learning Classification Model with KNIME
The goal of this projectis to build a model that is able to predict the median housing price in any district in California , given all other attributes using the California census data. This data has features such as population, median income, median housing price and so on for each district in California.The gradient random forest model was built to predict the median housing. In doing this 80% of the data was into the training data and 20%  into the test data.The model was cross validated to increase its accuracy and the hyperparaters were fine-tuned
The root mean squrare error after training the model was 69.918 and after cross validation is 70.296 which implies the model was over-fitting the training data set and can be reactified by adding more data to the traing data set.
